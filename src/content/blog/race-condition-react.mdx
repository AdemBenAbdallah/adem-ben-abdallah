Imagine you have a React component that fetches data based on an `id` prop.
The component uses useEffect to fetch the data whenever the `id` changes, and then displays the results.

However, you've noticed something odd: sometimes the data shown is accurate, but other times it's incorrect or outdated.

This inconsistency is likely due to a race condition.

In React, a race condition often occurs when two similar data requests are made, and the result displayed depends on which request finishes first.

In this case, if the `id prop` changes quickly enough, the useEffect hook might trigger a race condition in the component's data fetching logic.

```js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export default function DataDisplayer(props) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch(`https://swapi.dev/api/people/${props.id}/`);
      const newData = await response.json();
      setData(newData);
    };

    fetchData();
  }, [props.id]);

  if (data) {
    return <div>{data.name}</div>;
  } else {
    return null;
  }
}
```

It might not be immediately clear that the above code is prone to race conditions,
so I created a [CodeSandbox](https://rb.gy/virx7o) to make it more apparent. In this example, I added a random delay of up to 12 seconds per request.

You can observe the intended behavior by clicking the "Fetch data!" button once. The component will simply display the data in response to the click.

However, things become more complex if you click the "Fetch data!" button rapidly multiple times.
The app will send out several requests, which may finish in a random order. The data from the last request to complete will be the one that gets displayed.

Here’s how the updated DataDisplayer component looks now:

```js showLineNumber {7,15}
export default function DataDisplayer(props) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [fetchedId, setFetchedId] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      setTimeout(async () => {
        const response = await fetch(
          `https://swapi.dev/api/people/${props.id}/`
        );
        const newData = await response.json();

        setFetchedId(props.id);
        setData(newData);
      }, Math.round(Math.random() * 12000));
    };

    fetchData();
  }, [props.id]);

  if (data) {
    return (
      <div>
        <p style={{ color: fetchedId === props.id ? "green" : "red" }}>
          Displaying Data for: {fetchedId}
        </p>
        <p>{data.name}</p>
      </div>
    );
  } else {
    return null;
  }
}
```

## Fixing the useEffect race condition

There are a couple of approaches we can take here, both taking
advantage of useEffect’s clean-up function:

- If we're okay with making several requests, but only rendering the last result, we can use a boolean flag.

- Alternatively, if we don't have to support users on Internet Explorer, we can use [AbortController](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController).

## useEffect Clean-up Function with Boolean Flag

First, the gist of our fix in code:

```js showLineNumber {2, 8,16,17,18}
useEffect(() => {
  let active = true;

  const fetchData = async () => {
    setTimeout(async () => {
      const response = await fetch(`https://swapi.dev/api/people/${props.id}/`);
      const newData = await response.json();
      if (active) {
        setFetchedId(props.id);
        setData(newData);
      }
    }, Math.round(Math.random() * 12000));
  };

  fetchData();
  return () => {
    active = false;
  };
}, [props.id]);
```

This fix relies on an often overlooked sentence in the [React Hooks API reference](https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#step-3-add-cleanup-if-needed):

> Additionally, if a component renders multiple times (as they typically do), the previous effect is cleaned up before executing the next effect
> .

In the example above:

- changing `props.id` will cause a re-render,
- every re-render will trigger the clean-up function to run, setting `active` to `false`,
- with `active` set to `false`, the now-stale requests won't be able to update our state

You'll still have a race-condition in the sense that multiple requests will be in-flight,
but only the results from the last one will be used.

It's likely not immediately obvious why the clean-up function in useEffect would fix this issue.
I'd recommend you see this fix in action, by checking out the [CodeSandbox](https://rb.gy/5tj3cp)
(I also added a counter to track the number of active requests, and couple of helper functions).

## useEffect Clean-up Function with AbortController

Again, let's start with the code:

```js {2, 8,25,26,27}
useEffect(() => {
  const abortController = new AbortController();

  const fetchData = async () => {
    setTimeout(async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(`https://swapi.dev/api/people/${id}/`, {
          signal: abortController.signal,
        });
        const newData = await response.json();

        setFetchedId(id);
        setData(newData);
      } catch (error) {
        if (error.name === "AbortError") {
          // Aborting a fetch throws an error
          // So we can't update state afterwards
        }
        // Handle other request errors here
      }
    }, Math.round(Math.random() * 12000));
  };

  fetchData();
  return () => {
    abortController.abort();
  };
}, [id]);
```

Like in the previous example, we're taking advantage of React's behavior of running the clean-up function before executing the next effect. You can explore this in the [CodeSandbox](https://rb.gy/xx6ejb) as well (in this case, we're not tracking the number of requests since only one can be active at any given time).

In this example, we are:

- Initializing an `AbortController` at the start of the effect.
- Passing the [`AbortController.signal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController/signal) to the `fetch` function via the options argument.
- Catching any `AbortErrors` that are thrown (when `abort()` is called, the `fetch()` promise rejects with an `AbortError`; see [MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController/abort)).
- Calling the abort function within the clean-up function.

This approach presents a trade-off: you'll need to drop support for Internet Explorer or use a polyfill in exchange for the ability to cancel in-progress HTTP requests.
