## **Introduction**

JavaScript error handling is about to get a major upgrade. The new ECMAScript
Safe Assignment Operator Proposal (?=) is here to streamline your code by
reducing the need for traditional try-catch blocks. Letâ€™s explore how this
proposal can simplify your error management and make your JavaScript code cleaner
and more efficient.

## **Simplified Error Handling**

### **No More Nested Try-Catch**

- **Problem**: Traditional `try-catch` blocks often lead to deeply nested code, making
  it harder to read and maintain.
- **Solution**: The `?= `operator reduces nesting by transforming the result of a function
  into a tuple. If an error occurs, it returns `[error, null];` otherwise, it returns `[null, result]`.

**Example**

```js
   async function getData() {
     const [error, response] ?= await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
     if (error) return handleError(error);
     return response;
   }
```

Enhanced Readability
Cleaner, More Linear Code

- **Problem**: `Try-catch` blocks can clutter code and disrupt the flow of logic.
- **Solution**: The `?=` operator makes error handling more intuitive, keeping your
  code linear and easy to follow.

  **Example**

```js
 const [error, data] ?= await someAsyncFunction();
  if (error) handle(error);
```

## **Consistency Across APIs**

Uniform Error Handling

- **Problem**: Different APIs might require different error-handling techniques, leading to inconsistencies.
- **Solution**: The ?= operator introduces a consistent way to handle errors across all APIs, ensuring uniform behavior.

## **Improved Security**

Never Miss an Error Again

- **Problem**: Overlooking error handling can lead to unnoticed bugs and potential security risks.
- **Solution**: By automatically handling errors in a standardized way, the ?= operator reduces the chance of missing critical errors.

## **Symbol.result: The Secret Sauce**

Customizable Error Handling

- **Overview**: Objects that implement the Symbol.result method can use the ?= operator to define their own error-handling logic.
- **Usage**: The Symbol.result method should return a tuple [error, result].

**Example**

```js
function example() {
     return {
       [Symbol.result]() {
         return [new Error("Error message"), null];
       },
     };
   }
   const [error, result] ?= example();
```

## **Recursive Error Handling**

Handle Nested Errors Like a Pro

- **Overview**: The ?= operator can recursively handle nested objects that implement Symbol.result, ensuring even complex error scenarios are managed smoothly.

**Example**

```js
 const obj = {
     [Symbol.result]() {
       return [
         null,
         { [Symbol.result]: () => [new Error("Nested error"), null] }
       ];
     },
   };
   const [error, data] ?= obj;
```

## **Promises and Async Functions**

Async Error Handling Made Easy

- **Overview**: The ?= operator is designed to work seamlessly with Promises
  and async/await, making error handling in asynchronous code straightforward.

**Example**

```js
const [error, data] ?= await fetch("https://api.example.com");
```

## **Using Statement Integration**

Streamline Resource Management

- **Overview**: The ?= operator can be used with using statements to manage
  resources more effectively, making cleanup easier and less error-prone.

**Example**

```js
    await using [error, resource] `?=` getResource();
```

## **Why Not Data First?**

Prioritizing Error Handling

- **Overview**: Placing the error first in the [error, data] ?= structure ensures that errors
  are handled before processing data, reducing the risk of ignoring errors.

**Example**

```js
   const [error, data] ?= someFunction();
```

## **Polyfilling the Operator**

Future-Proof Your Code

- **Overview**: While the ?= operator cannot be polyfilled directly, its behavior can be
  simulated using post-processors to maintain compatibility with older environments.

**Example**

```js
const [error, data] = someFunction[Symbol.result]();
```

## **Learning from Other Languages**

Inspired by the Best

- **Overview**: The pattern behind the ?= operator is inspired by similar constructs in languages
  like Go, Rust, and Swift, which have long embraced more structured error handling.

Current Limitations and Areas for Improvement
Still a Work in Progress

- **Nomenclature**: The proposal needs a clear term for objects implementing Symbol.result.

- **Finally Blocks**: Thereâ€™s no new syntax for finally blocks, but you can still use them in the traditional way.

## **Conclusion**

The Safe Assignment Operator (?=) is a game-changer for JavaScript error handling, promising to
reduce the need for clunky try-catch blocks and make your code cleaner and more secure. Although still
in development, this proposal could soon become a standard tool in every JavaScript developerâ€™s toolkit.
